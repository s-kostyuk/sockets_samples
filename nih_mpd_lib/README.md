**Library is moved** to the separate repo: [s-kostyuk/nih_mpd_lib](https://github.com/s-kostyuk/nih_mpd_lib) 

Simple MPD client, written with "not invited here" reason. A coroutine-based alternative to synchronous [python-mpd2](https://github.com/Mic92/python-mpd2) and asynchronous [aiompd](https://github.com/zzzsochi/aiompd).

For usage samples see [./client_demo.py](./client_demo.py), scroll straight to `main` block.

For MPD Client implementation see [./mpd_client.py](./mpd_client.py).
